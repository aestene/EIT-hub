+ To test it just launch two local instances of index.html. Modify one so it says `index.html#1`. This will be the client you will stream from. Allow webcam to record. 
Then copy the string form `index.html#1` to the textarea in `index.html` and hit submit. Now do the same the other way and a video stream will show in `index.html`.
