Short RPi Zero W IoT configuration recipe

When receiving your unit you need to perform the following steps to be ready using RPi with the Enviro module
1. Set up SSH with the supplied USB cable
2. Change your password
3. Configure WiFi
4. Update the installed OS/software
5. Install the Enviro Python library
6. Experiment :)

1. Set up SSH with the supplied USB cable

Mac: 
1. Attach the USB cable to your computer then to the left Micro USB connector on the RPi Zero
2. Open Terminal
3. ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
4. Enter the initial password when prompted: raspberry

PC: 
1. Attach the USB cable to your computer then to the left Micro USB connector on the RPi Zero
2. Install Bonjour and Putty
3. Run Putty (See step 6-9 in https://desertbot.io/blog/headless-pi-zero-w-wifi-setup-windows)
4. ssh pi@raspberrypi.local (note: I’m using a Mac and haven’t tested Putty, so your milage may vary)
5. Enter the initial password when prompted: raspberry

2. Change your password
This can be done in several ways:
- Configure with sudo raspi-config (see further instructions below) through a SSH connection using the supplied USB cable
- Configure with sudo passwd through a SSH connection using the supplied USB cable

3. Configure WiFi
This can be done in several ways:
- Configure with sudo raspi-config (see further instructions below) through a SSH connection using the supplied USB cable
- Create/add a file called wpa_supplicant.conf to the root of the supplied SDHC card
- Create/add a file called wpa_supplicant.conf with the CLI command sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf through a SSH connection using the supplied USB cable

Using raspi-config to set password and configure WiFi (+++)
Once connected to the RPi Zero W run:
sudo raspi-config

Configure the following
1 Change user password
2 -> N2 Wi-fi
Enter SSID (your WiFi name)
Enter password (for your WiFi)
4 -> I2 Change Timezone
Europe
Oslo

(You could also change the keyboard configuration, but my unit had issues with this and the change wouldn’t take.)

Example content of wpa_supplicant.conf file:
country=NO
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
	ssid="MyWiFiNetwork"
	psk="MyWiFiPassword"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

Note: you can create a hashed version of your WiFi password to avoid storing it in plain text on the memory card:
1. wpa_passphrase [MyWiFiNetwork] [MyWiFiPassword]
2. Copy the hashed password
3. sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
4. Paste the hashed password within the quote marks of the psk="MyWiFiPassword" and save
5. sudo reboot

4. Update the installed OS/software

Update base system (this takes time…)
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

5. Install the Enviro Python library
In the RPi CLI
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/enviroplus-python
cd enviroplus-python
sudo ./install.sh
sudo reboot

6. Experiment :)
In the RPi CLI
cd /home/pi/Pimoroni/enviroplus/examples

You can list all the files in the folder using:
ls 

Then you can run an example:
python all-in-one.py

Exit the example using CTRL+c
